/*
Sum square difference
Problem 6
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
	12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
	(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum
is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
